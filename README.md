Project Description:

Wiggle Wiggle Academy is a whimsical, underwater-themed web application dedicated to the noble and hilarious mission of teaching baby fish how to swim. It's a dynamic, full-stack platform that parodies modern e-learning systems, tailored entirely for our aquatic friends.

The Problem (that doesn't exist):

Across the vast, uncharted oceans, countless baby fish are wiggling aimlessly. Their potential is untapped, their technique is sloppy, and their parents are worried. There is a clear and present lack of a structured, credential-based educational system to turn these amateur floaters into professional swimmers.

The Solution (that nobody asked for):

Wiggle Wiggle Academy is the world's premier digital institution for aquatic locomotion. We provide a robust online platform where fish trainees can log in, receive a personalized swim kit, attend video tutorials, and be tested with a practical "Obstacle Fin-Course" exam. It's an over-engineered, completely useless solution to a problem that never existed.

This playful flowchart showcases the journey of a baby fish through Wiggle Wiggle Academy. Starting from the Home Screen, trainees access Video Tutorials and Class Notes, followed by being Assigned a Mentor. Their Attendance is auto-tracked while they engage in Practical Exams and receive Swim Kits for training. Progress is reflected in the Leaderboard, and everything is managed via the Admin Panel — all set in a vibrant, underwater-themed e-learning ecosystem for fish
